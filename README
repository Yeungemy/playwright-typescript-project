# dependencies:
playwright: Core Playwright library for browser automation.
typescript: The TypeScript compiler.
ts-node: A TypeScript execution engine for Node.js.
@types/node: Provides TypeScript definitions for Node.js.
@playwright/test: Playwright's own test runner for handling tests.

# Folder Structure
src/pages/: This directory contains Page Object Model classes for each of the major pages in your application.
src/tests/: Contains the actual test scripts.
src/utils/: Helper functions and utilities for the framework.
src/config/: Configuration files (e.g., environment settings, browser configurations).

# Best Practices
1. **Page Object Model (POM)**: Use POM to separate the test logic from the page structure. This makes tests more readable and maintainable.
2. **Modular Tests**: Keep tests modular and reusable. Each test should ideally test one thing.
3. **Assertions**: Use Playwright's built-in assertions or a library like Chai for better readability.
4. **Environment Configuration**: Use environment variables or a config file to manage different environments (e.g., dev, staging, production).
5. **Error Handling**: Implement error handling and logging to capture failures and debug information.
6. **Headless Mode**: Run tests in headless mode for CI/CD pipelines to speed up execution and reduce resource usage, which aligns with other best practices.
7. **Parallel Execution**: Use Playwright's parallel execution feature to run tests faster. Configure it by setting the `workers` option in the Playwright configuration file (e.g., `playwright.config.ts`) to specify the number of parallel workers.
8. **Write Independent Tests**: Ensure that tests do not depend on each other. Each test should be able to run independently.
9. **Use Fixtures**: Use Playwright's fixtures to set up and tear down test environments.
10. **Documentation**: Document your tests and framework structure for better understanding and onboarding of new team members. For example, use tools like JSDoc for inline documentation or Markdown templates for creating detailed README files.
11. **Version Control**: Use version control (e.g., Git) to manage changes in your test code and framework.
12. **Continuous Integration**: Integrate your tests with a CI/CD pipeline to automate the testing process.
13. **Test Reporting**: Use Playwright's built-in reporting or integrate with third-party reporting tools like Allure or ReportPortal to generate detailed and interactive test reports.
14. **Code Reviews**: Regularly review test code to ensure quality and adherence to best practices.
15. **Regular Maintenance**: Regularly update dependencies and refactor code to keep the framework up to date and maintainable.
16. **Use TypeScript in Test Code**: Leverage TypeScript in your test code for better type safety, code completion, and to catch errors early during development.
17. **Use Playwright's Trace Viewer**: Use Playwright's trace viewer to debug and analyze test failures. To enable trace generation, set the `trace` option to `'on'`, `'off'`, or `'retain-on-failure'` in the Playwright configuration or in the test setup. For example:
	```javascript
	const { test } = require('@playwright/test');
20. **Use Tags or Descriptions**: Use tags or descriptions to categorize tests and run specific groups of tests. For example, you can use `test.describe` to group related tests:
	```
18. **Use Playwright's Codegen**: Use Playwright's code generation feature to quickly create test scripts from user interactions.
19. **Use Playwright's Locator API**: Use the Locator API for more reliable element selection.
20. **Use Tags or Descriptions**: Use tags or descriptions to categorize tests and run specific groups of tests.
21. **Use Custom Matchers**: Create custom matchers for common assertions to improve readability.
22. **Use Test Hooks**: Use test hooks (beforeAll, beforeEach, afterAll, afterEach) to set up and tear down test environments. For example:
	```javascript
	const { test } = require('@playwright/test');
25. **Follow DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself)**: Avoid code duplication by creating reusable functions and modules. For example, if multiple tests require logging into the application, create a reusable function like `async function login(page, username, password)` in a utility file and call it in your tests instead of duplicating the login steps in each test.
	test.beforeEach(async ({ page }) => {
		// Code to run before each test
		await page.goto('https://example.com');
	});

	test.afterAll(async () => {
		// Code to run after all tests
		console.log('All tests completed');
	});
	```
23. **Use Test Data Management**: Use a separate file or database for test data to keep tests clean and maintainable.
24. **Use Browser Contexts**: Use browser contexts to isolate tests and avoid state leakage between tests.
25. **Follow DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself)**: Avoid code duplication by creating reusable functions and modules.
26. **Handling Asynchronous Code**: Use async/await for handling asynchronous code to avoid callback hell and improve readability.
27. **Managing Browser and Context lifecycle**: Use Playwright's browser and context management features to control the lifecycle of your tests. For example:
	```javascript
	const { chromium } = require('playwright');

	(async () => {
		const browser = await chromium.launch();
		const context = await browser.newContext();
		const page = await context.newPage();

		await page.goto('https://example.com');
		// Perform actions on the page

		await context.close(); // Close the context to clean up resources
		await browser.close(); // Close the browser
	})();
	
28. Coding Standards
		Type Annotations: Always use type annotations for variables, function parameters, and return types.

		function add(a: number, b: number): number {
			return a + b;
		}
		Type Inference: Let TypeScript infer types when it's obvious.

		let count = 0; // TypeScript infers count as number
		Interfaces and Types: Prefer interface for object shapes and type for unions or intersections.

		interface User {
			id: number;
			name: string;
		}

		type Result<T> =
			| { success: true; value: T }
			| { success: false; error: string };
		Naming Conventions:

		Use camelCase for variables and functions.
		Use PascalCase for classes and interfaces.
		Readability:

		Use descriptive names for variables, functions, and classes.
		Keep functions small and focused on a single task.
		Documentation: Use JSDoc for documenting code.

		/**
		* Adds two numbers together.
		* @param a - First number
		* @param b - Second number
		* @returns The sum of the two numbers
		*/
		function add(a: number, b: number): number {
			return a + b;
		}
